DAMONA
######

Damona is a collections of singularity recipes that can be used to build software used in
NGS pipelines. It provides a simple excutable to download and configure the
images locally.

Motivation
==========

Why another collections or tools to provide NGS images ? There is bioconda, and
a bunch of collections of singularity images indeed !

I see two main reasons to start **damona** software. First, Bioconda is great but there are two small limitations: some tools are not there or installing two tools may be impossible due to conflits; those conflicts may be long to untangle. Remember that bioconda allows you to build an environment with all tools living altogether. Some may be in conflicts. Second, singularity images posted here are there are a great source of inspirations. Yet, I wanted a very simple tool for my users and hide the nitty-gritty details of singularity. In practice, on a cluster, you can get the missing tools in a few seconds. Your system administrator can install singularity and damona and then you can download ready-to-use executables.

Our goal is not to replace existing initiative but just to complement them when
required. In particular, we designed **damona** so as to provide the executables
required by sequana.readthedocs.io pipelines. 

Installation
============

1. Install singularity: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html
2. Install **Damona** using **pip**. You will need Python 3.X::

    pip install damona --upgrade

The dependencies of **Damona** are pure python so it should be straightfoward.

Usage
=====


Print the list of images available within Damona collections::

    damona list

Download the one you want to use::

    damona pull fastqc:0.11.9

This will download the container in your ./config/damona directory and create an
executable for you in ~/.config/damona/bin. 

You just need to append your PATH. For instance under Linux, type:

    export PATH=~/config/damona/bin:$PATH

You you can also add in your .profile or .bashrc file for this command to be
permanent.

You are ready to go. Just type this command to use the newly installed container::

    fastqc --help

Check that you have not installed another version::

    which fastqc

This should show you the path *~/.config/damona/bin/fastqc*. Of course, tThis tool is pretty common in NGS and can be easily installed. This is more a toy example than a real example.

In damona there are three classes of container:

1. executables (like the one above)
2. environement: for instance, we provide an image for R v4.0.2. This is not a NGS tool per se but can be used to build other containers. 
3. Set of executables (coming soon)
