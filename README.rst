Overview
========

Damona is a singularity environment manager.

Damona started as a small collections of singularity recipes to help installing third-party tools for
`Sequana NGS pipelines <https://sequana.readthedocs.io>`_.

Damona is now used in production to create reproducible environments where singularity images and their associated binaries are installed altogether.

In a nutshell, Damona combines the logic of Conda environments with the
reproducibility of singularity containers. We believe that it could be useful for
other projects and therefore decided to release it as an independent tool.

* As of 11st July 2023, **Damona** contains 64 software, 107 releases 400 binaries.


Installation
============

If you are in a hurry, just type::

    pip install damona --upgrade

You must install `Singularity <https://sylabs.io/docs>`_ to make use of **Damona**.

If you are familiar with conda, I believe you can do::

    conda install singularity

Type **damona** in a shell. This will initiate the tool with a config file in your HOME/.config/damona directory for bash shell and `fish shell <https://fishshell.com/>`_ users.

Bash users should add this code in their ~/.bashrc file::

    source ~/.config/damona/damona.sh

Fish shell users should add the following code in their ~/.config/fish/config.fish file::

    source ~/.config/damona/damona.fish

Zsh users should add the following code in their ~/.config/fish/config.fish file::

    source ~/.config/damona/damona.zsh

Open a new shell and you are ready to go. Please see the `Installation in details`_ section for more information.

Quick Start
===========

**Damona** needs environments to work with.
First, let us *create* one, which is called TEST::

    damona create TEST

Second, we need to *activate* it. Subsequent insallation will happen in this environment::

    damona activate TEST

From there, we can install some binaries/images::

    damona install fastqc:0.11.9

That's it. Time to test. Type **fastqc**.

To rename this TEST example::

    damona rename TEST --new-name prod

or delete it::

    damona delete prod

See more examples hereafter or in the user guide on https://damona.readthedocs.io

Motivation
==========

As stated on their website, `Conda <https:/docs.conda.io/en/latest>`_ is
an open source **package** management system
and **environment** management system.
Conda provides pre-compiled releases of software; they can be installed in
different local environments that do not interfer with your system. This has
great advantages for developers. For example, you can install a pre-compiled
libraries in a minute instead of trying to compile it yourself including all
dependencies. Different communities have emerged using this
framework. One of them is `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_, which is dedicated to bioinformatics.

Another great tool that emerged in the last years is
`Singularity <https://sylabs.io/docs>`_. Singularity containers can be used
to package entire scientific workflows,
software and libraries, and even data. It is a simple file that can be shared
between environments and guarantee exectution and reproducibility.

Originally, Conda provided pre-compiled version of a software. Nowadays, it also provides
a docker and a singularity image of the tool. On the other side, Singularity can include an
entire conda environment. As you can see everything is there to build reproducible tools and
environment.

Now, what about a software in development that depends on third-party packages ? 
You would create a conda environment and starts installing the required packages.
Quickly, you will install another package that will break your environment due
to unresolved conlicts; this is not common but it happens. In the worst case
scenario, the environment is broken. In facilities where users depends on you,
it can be quite stresful and time-consuming to maintain several such
environments. This is why we have moved little by little to a very light conda
environment where known-to-cause-problem packages have been shipped into
singularity containers. This means we have to create aliases to those
singularities. The singularities can be simple executable containers or full
environment containers with many executables inside. In both cases, one need to
manage those containers for different users, pipelines, versions etc. This
started to be cumbersome to have containers in different places and update
script that generate the aliases to those executables.


That's where **damona** started: we wanted to combine the conda-like environment 
framework to manage our singularity containers more easily.

Although **Damona** was started with the `Sequana projet <https://sequana.readthedocs.io>`_,
**Damona** may be useful for others developers who wish to have a quick and easy
solution for their users when they need to install third-party libraries.

Before showing real-case examples, let us install the software itself and 
understand the details.



Installation in details
=======================

The is the egg and chicken paradox. To get reproducible container with
singularity, at some point you need to install singularity itself. That the first
of the two software that you will need to install. Instructions
are on `singularity web site <https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/>`_. This
is not obvious to be honest. You need the GO language to be installed as well. I
personally installed from source and it worked like a charm.

Second, you need **Damona**. This is a pure Python sotfware with only a few
dependencies. Install it with the **pip** software provided with your Python
installation (Python 3.X)::

    pip install damona --upgrade

Type **damona** to create the Damona tree structure. Images and binaries 
will be saved in your home directory within the
~/.config/damona directory. There, special files should be available:
**damona.sh**, **damona.fish**  and **damona.cfg**. Check that those files are present.

Finally, you need to tell your system where to find damona. For bashrc users,
please add this line to you bashrc file::

    source ~/.config/damona/damona.sh

open a new shell and type **damona** and you should be ready to go.

For fishshell users, please add this line in **~/.config/fish/config.fish***::

    source ~/.config/damona/damona.fish

Tutorial
============

The **Damona** standalone is called **damona**. It has a documentation that should suffice for most users.

The main documentation is obtained using::

    damona --help

where you will see the list of **Damona** commands (may be different with time) (may be::


    activate    Activate a damona environment.
    clean       Remove orphan images and binaries from all environments.
    create      Create a new environment
    deactivate  Deactivate the current Damona environment.
    delete      Remove an environment
    env         List all environemnts with some stats.
    export      Create a bundle of a given environment.
    info        Print information about a given environment.
    install     Download and install an image and its binaries.
    list        List all packages that can be installed
    remove      Remove binaries or image from an environment.
    rename      Rename an existing environment
    search      Search for a container or binary.
    stats       Get information about Damona images and binaries


To get help for the *install* command, type::

    damona install --help


1. *list* available environments
--------------------------------

By default you have an environment called **base**. Unlike the **base** environment found in **conda**, it is not
essential and may be altered. However, it cannot be removed or created. You can check the list of environments using::

    damona env

2. *create* environments
------------------------
All environments are stored in *~/.config/damona/envs/*. You can create a new one as follows::

    damona create TEST

There, you have a *bin* directory where binaries are going to be installed.

You can check that it has been created::

    damona env

Note the last line telling you that::

    Your current env is 'TEST'.

3. activate and deactivate environments
----------------------------------------

In order to install new binaries or software package, you must activate an environment. You may activate several but the last one is the *active* one. Let us activate the *TEST* environment::

    damona activate TEST

Check that it is active using::

    damona env

and look at the last line. It should look like::

    Your current env is 'TEST'.

What is going on when you activate an environment called TEST ? Simple: we append the directory ~/.config/damona/envs/TEST/bin to your PATH where binaries are searched for. This directory is removed when you use the *deactivate* command.

::

    damona deactivate TEST
    damona env 

should remove the TEST environment from your PATH. You may activate several and deactivate them. In such case, the
environments behave as a Last In First Out principle::

    damona activate base
    damona activate TEST
    damona deactivate 

Removes the last activated environments. While this set of commands is more specific::

    damona activate base
    damona activate TEST
    damona deactivate base

and keep the TEST environment only in your PATH.

4. **install** a software
--------------------------

Let us now consider that the TEST environment is active.

Damona provides software that may have several releases. Each software/release comes with binaries that will be
installed together with the underlying singularity image.::

    damona install fastqc:0.11.9

Here, the singularity image corresponding to the release 0.11.9 of the **fastqc** software is downloaded. Then, binaries registered in this release are installed (here the **fastqc** binary only).

All images are stored in *~/.config/damona/images* and are shared between environments. 


5. Get **info** about installed images and binaries
----------------------------------------------------

You can get the binaries installed in an environment (and the images used by
them) using the **info** command::

    damona info TEST


6. Search the registry
------------------------

You can search for a binary using::

    damona search PATTERN

External registry can be set-up. For instance, a damona registry is accessible
as follows (for demonstration)::

    damona search fastqc --url damona

Where *damona* is an alias defined in the .config/damona/damona.cfg that
is set to https://biomics.pasteur.fr/drylab/damona/registry.txt

You may retrieve images from a website where a registry exists (see the developer
guide to create a registry yourself).


7. combine two different environments
--------------------------------------

In damona, you can have sereral environments in parallel and later activate the
one you wish to use. Let us create a new one::

    damone create test1

and check that you now have one more environment::

    damona env

We want to create an alias to the previously downloaded image of fastqc tool but
in the *test1* environment. First we activate the newly create environment::

    damona activate test1

then, we install the container::

    damona install fastqc:0.11.9

This will not download the image again. It will just create a binary in the
~/.config/damona/envs/test1/bin directory.

you can combine this new environment with the base one::

    damona activate base

If you are interested to know more, please see the User Guide and Developer
guide here below.
