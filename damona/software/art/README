art latest version from https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art is 2.5.8 -
but from conda, there are 3 versions:

- 3.11.14
- 3.19.15
- 2016.06.05


it appears the conda version 2016.06.05 is 2.5.8
besides, the 3.11.14 and 3.19.15 are wrongly labelled in conda. They actually correspond to 2.1.8 and 2.3.7

the version 3.11.14 was uploaded to zenodo unfortunately. The version 3.19.15 was named 2.3.7 so that it is correct. As for the 3.11.14 / 2.1.8 we keep the wrong version on zenodo, but the registry is fixed with the correct version.
